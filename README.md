# OpenAI WebRTC Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's API with WebRTC to create a real-time communication application. The application captures audio from the user's microphone, sends it to OpenAI's API, and receives a response that is played back to the user.
There's also signaling server to establish a WebRTC connection between the two peers.

## Features

- Capture audio using the browser's `getUserMedia` API.
- Establish a WebRTC connection to transmit audio data.
- Send the audio data to OpenAI's API for processing.
- Receive and display the AI-generated response.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/openai-webrtc-integration.git
   cd openai-webrtc-integration
   ```
